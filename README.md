# AIWD6-dataset
## Dataset for capturing continuous weather scenarios
We introduce a large-scale comprehensive dataset known as the Adverse Intermediate Weather Driving (AIWD6) dataset. This dataset comprises six transitional weather states designed for autonomous driving scenarios: cloudy to rainy, rainy to cloudy, sunny to rainy, rainy to sunny, sunny to foggy, and foggy to sunny. These transitional states are generated at various temporal scales. Further, we propose an approach to classify the transitional weather images using a gated recurrent unit (GRU). We anticipate that our dataset with realistic continuous weather shifts will shape the data collection paradigm for real-world driving datasets and advance scene perception techniques for AVs.

The overall breakdown of the AIWD6 dataset is given below, where the number of input samples for each discrete weather condition are 293.
